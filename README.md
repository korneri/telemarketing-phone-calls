# Term deposit prediction

This data relates to telemarketing phone calls to sell long-term deposits. Within a campaign, the agents make phone calls to a list of clients to sell the product (outbound) or, if meanwhile the client calls the contact-center for any other reason, he is asked to subscribe the product (inbound). Thus, the result is a binary unsuccessful or successful contact.
This study considers real data collected from one of the retail bank, from May 2008 to June 2010, in a total of 39883 phone contacts. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.
The purpose of our project is to be able to predict a successful contact (the client subscribes to the product). The rest variables are potential candidates for examining the variable under study. We are going to employ 3 methods and compare them.
